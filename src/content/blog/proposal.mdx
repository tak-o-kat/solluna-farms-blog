## Abstract

Solluna mushroom farms is a farm-to-table business that is adopting Algorands blockchain technology to educate and onboard mushroom growers and buyers.

We aim to achieve this by implementing 3 key features to our business plan. These will include an ASA (Algorand Standard Asset) rewards only program for our customers and supporters, an NFT based grow kit and farming course, and an innovative environmentally green mushroom farm.

## Team

## Experience with Algorand

## Present Proposal

#### SPORE Token

The farm will incorporate the SPORE token into the business model by giving holders discounts on our products. SPORE will be sent to clients that participate in our discord and Texas holdem poker tournaments.

#### NFTs

We plan on creating mushroom grow kits with NFTs associated to each type of kit. These NFTs will have information about the fungus, a spore print, and how to grow and take care of your new fungus.

#### Fungal Courses

Our courses will assist new growers with retaining existing mushroom farm practices that can be easily transferred to their own farms. These courses will also include basic understanding of the Algorand ecosystem and technology, we will be doing this in order to prep our clients for future collaborations.

#### Environmentally friendly farm

Our farms will be producing fungi by using repurposed recycled plastic with outdoor elements that will assist in healthy fungus.

## Future Blueprint

## Benefits for the community

#### Genuine Rewards Program

The SPORE token’s only purpose is as a rewards and discount token for our products. This token will not be available on decentralized exchanges or other decentralized finance applications. SPORE can be used with out products to get up to a 20% discount, the amount of SPORE needed to get the full 20% discount will be voted on by our community.

#### Educational

The on-boarding of new Algorand users will occur with each new student that completes our courses. Courses will explain how the Algorand blockchain works and how we integrate our farms with the technology.

#### Unique NFT use case

Each type of grow kit for a particular fungus will come with an NFT that provides detailed information on what the grower has purchased. This means for every grow kit sold, a grower will use the Algorand chain in order to read their instructions and get more information about the fungus.
